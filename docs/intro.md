# Introduction


## Motivation

### Fast fashion and its environmental impact
Fast fashion, that enticing realm of ever-changing trends and affordable clothing, holds a dark secret beneath its shiny surface. It's a secret that's impacting our planet profoundly. The rapid production and quick turnover of inexpensive garments might seem harmless, but their environmental cost is staggering. The relentless pursuit of low-cost, disposable fashion has led to a relentless cycle of resource depletion, pollution, and waste. From the overconsumption of water and energy in textile production to the disposal of vast quantities of clothing in landfills, fast fashion has a profound and negative impact on the environment. It contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, chemical pollution, and the depletion of natural resources. Recognizing the urgent need for change, many are now advocating for a shift towards sustainable and ethical fashion practices to mitigate these environmental consequences

## Goals
Our goal by creating RNDVOUZ is to combact the impact fast fashion have on the environment by creating an easy to use, fun, and
interactive app that allows users to seamlessly exchange/trade their clothing with the swipe of a screen. 

Our motto for this app is:
>*"Helping sustainable clothing, one swipe at a time"*.
