# RNDVOUZ Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals
1. Users are able to able to seamlessly find/trade/sell clothes that they/others no longer want.
    1. Users are able to create/setup an account (upload a profile picture, select their sizes, etc...)
    2. Users are able to upload what they are wearing currently to be put up for sale/trade/negotiation
    3. Users are able to swipe left and right on the browse page to select items of interest.

## Scenario 1
Imagine you just cleaned out your closet and picked out a handful of clothes you don't want to keep. You would describe your normal, everyday style to be simple and casual, but lately you've been wanting to try out something different. Unfortunately, clothes cost money, and you're on a tight budget. Your friend suggests that you try this new app. You make an account, upload some of your old clothes to the app, and browse around to try to find something that you like. 

### Successful Behavior
- Make an account and navigate the app without much issue
- Feel like the account setup helps to personalize user experience in an interesting way
- Find the app interesting/promising
- Enjoy browsing clothes

## Scenario 2
Imagine you are preparing for a themed costume party that's happening in a week. The party is hippie-themed. You realized you don't have any hippie-like clothes at home, so you want to find specific hippie-esque clothing items without breaking the bank. You happen to have some old clothes you are willing to trade or sell to get what you need. You scour the web, but the only available options are thredUP, Depop, and Plato's Closet. None of which supports local trading. This is where our app **RNDVOUZ** comes into play. Find a good hippie-esque jacket. 

### Successful Behavior
- Able to search for jackets using the search feature

## User Types
1. Budget-focused: Individuals who are price-sensitive. May regularly buy secondhand clothes, discounted clothes, and/or fast fashion, whichever is better for their wallet. 
2. Enviroment-focused: Individuals who are more environmentally-conscious. Willing to spend more money/time/effort to pick more sustainable/eco-friendly options.
3. Combined: People are both price-sensitive and environmentally-conscious. 
4. Neither: The average person. Doesn't heavily emphasize price nor environmental impact. 

## Recruitment
Participants recruited for for the usability test were typically acquaintances of the developers. 

## Consent Form
[Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R55Uu4LVsHBIqY4rZzd1Yqa4FQc6VfF5/view?usp=drive_link) to view the consent form.

## Anonymized Description of the Participants
### Participant A:
Female gradute student interested in clothes and fashion.

### Participant B:
Female gradute student interested in clothes and fashion. She identifies as user type 4, Neither.

> I think I am 4. Neither. I do prefer to buy things on sale - but if I see something that I really want that looks good quality, I will buy it at the regular price if I can afford it.

> Generally I do not buy fast fashion. But it is not because I am environmentally focused. It is just because I like to wear my clothes many times before they are too worn out to wear anymore.

> So, if I were to buy or trade clothes on your app, I would probably choose unique-looking, vintage items (like vintage denim that will probably last me a while) or dress outfits (if I need something for an event that I will probably not wear often, and don't want to pay full price)

## Time & Place
For participants A & B, the usability took place on December 6, 2023 at around 3:00 pm at the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. 

## Script

## Raw Data
### Participant A
Participant's A impressions of the app is positive. 

> I've always thought about how I can minimize waste when I want to get rid of clothes but have't really considered trying to find one. But it's a really cool idea. I imagine it's something similar to Facebook Marketplace or some clothes flipping apps but more personalized and perhaps easier to find the right person to buy or sell clothes than some of the existing ones.


> I would find this app to be very cool because I like to find unusual clothes and I think it would be nice to be able to try out outfits this way that I wouldn't feel guilty about buying. Because after I use it, I know that there is a community (people that frequently use the app) that are likely to buy it. I think this would be great for things like Halloween costumes (like the use case described), but also for fancy outfits like dresses (e.g. for prom dresses, or wedding attendee dresses, or clothes that don't fit me anymoreðŸ˜†).
>
> I've shopped on Etsy before (another online community where single-person/small homegrown businesses sell their items, usually crafts, artwork and clothes). This app reminded me of Etsy, but with a stronger fashion focus. Etsy is more geared towards artwork and custom designs.

### Participant B
Participant's B impressions of the app is positive. 

> I thought it'd be cool!! I would try it out. I always try find solutions to my clothes I don't wear anymore.

> It looks fun! It looks like there is an ability to chat with other people in the community - so it looks like a fun way to make new friends! It is easy to "like" an outfit and I like how it has different filters by style options. It is easy to explore the different style options - so it makes it easy to try out different fashions. I would use this app!

## Observations

### Participant A
Participant A was using our device as an emulator to navigate through the app. While going through the set up process they had a lot of questions about what each set up section was about. The process for setting up their account took longer than expected because we needed provide a lot of explanation while walking them through the set up process. 

### Participant B
Participant B was using our device as an emulator to navigate through the app. While they were using the browse swiping mode, they sometimes misclicked on their swipes and wished they could change what they swiped on because they didn't want to accidentally indicate that it is an item they are interested in. 

## Results

1. For the set up process and for the app in general, it may be useful to have a tutorial section before they dive into using the app. There could be little instructions and descriptions about what is going on in the set up process and how to measure yourself.
2. Add a revert option when swiping through the swipe browsing mode so that users who misclick while swiping can still revert their changes.
