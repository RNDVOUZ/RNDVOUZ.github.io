# RNDVOUZ Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals
1. Users are able to able to seamlessly find/trade/sell clothes that they/others no longer want.
    1. Users are able to create/setup an account (upload a profile picture, select their sizes, etc...)
    2. Users are able to upload what they are wearing currently to be put up for sale/trade/negotiation
    3. Users are able to swipe left and right on the browse page to select items of interest.

## Scenario 1
Imagine you just cleaned out your closet and picked out a handful of clothes you don't want to keep. You would describe your normal, everyday style to be simple and casual, but lately you've been wanting to try out something different. Unfortunately, clothes cost money, and you're on a tight budget. Your friend suggests that you try this new app. You make an account, upload some of your old clothes to the app, and browse around to try to find something that you like. 

#### Successful Behavior
- Make an account and navigate the app without much issue
- Feel like the account setup helps to personalize user experience in an interesting way
- Find the app interesting/promising
- Enjoy browsing clothes

## Scenario 2
Imagine you are preparing for a themed costume party that's happening in a week. The party is hippie-themed. You realized you don't have any hippie-like clothes at home, so you want to find specific hippie-esque clothing items without breaking the bank. You happen to have some old clothes you are willing to trade or sell to get what you need. You scour the web, but the only available options are thredUP, Depop, and Plato's Closet. None of which supports local trading. This is where our app **RNDVOUZ** comes into play. Find a good hippie-esque jacket. 

#### Successful Behavior
- Able to search for jackets using the search feature
